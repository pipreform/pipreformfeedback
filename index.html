            <h2>Why the Voucher Scheme is Impractical</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Variety of Needs: Disabled individuals have diverse needs that vary greatly from person to person. Vouchers may not cover the wide range of required expenses from medical equipment to everyday necessities.</li>
                <li>Administrative Burden: Managing and processing claims for every specific need through vouchers could create a significant administrative burden leading to delays and inefficiencies.</li>
                <li>Limited Approved Suppliers: A voucher system might limit users to specific suppliers which could result in higher prices and reduced access to the most suitable or cost-effective products and services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why the Voucher Scheme Doesn't Address Our Needs</h2>
            <p>A voucher system would be practical or likely to cover the following:</p>
            
                <p>Ongoing costs (too regular to keep applying for every time):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Energy Costs: Higher utility bills due to medical equipment or needing to maintain a warmer home.</li>
                    <li>Support Costs: Personal trainers and therapists to manage physical and mental health.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance Costs: Home repairs and maintenance due to wheelchair wear and tear.</li>
                    <li>Companion Fees: Paying for a companion when unable to go alone.</li>
                    <li>Delivery Fees: Additional costs for home deliveries.</li>
                    <li>Travel Costs: Larger less economical vehicle needed or specialized transport and limited holiday accommodations options costing more (we can't camp).</li>
                    <li>Cleaning Services: Paying for professional cleaners.</li>
                    <li>Specialized Clothing: Higher costs for adaptive clothing.</li>
                    <li>Prescription Costs: Prescription expenses not covered due to disability alone not granting free prescriptions.</li>
                    <li>Lost Time and Income: Additional time lost due to disability limiting the ability to work full time and increased sick leave.</li>
                    <li>Higher Housing Costs: Higher rent or mortgage for larger accessible housing to fit equipment.</li>
                    <li>Adaptive Equipment: Costs for necessary adaptive equipment not covered by vouchers.</li>
                    <li>Incontinence Costs: Costs for replacing clothes and additional laundry expenses.</li>
                    <li>General assistance for common household tasks: replacing bulbs, fire alarm batteries and checks, bleeding radiators, decorating (Christmas and general), cleaning car, cutting grass/maintaining garden, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Annually:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased Insurance: Higher insurance premiums for larger more expensive vehicles and homes.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance of Equipment: Servicing and repairs on disabled equipment.</li>
                </ul>
                
            
            <p>Less regular costs that vouchers will be restrictive in covering and highly unlikely to be approved because of cost:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vehicle Adaptations: Costs for adapting vehicles.</li>
                <li>Extra cost of replacing vehicle and repairing unavoidable damage from wheelchair.</li>
                <li>Extra cost to repair and replace household items such as washing machine (as incontinence and increased usage reduces lifespan) or carpets (as wheelchairs wear down and pull up carpets far quicker).</li>
                <li>Smart Home Equipment: Costs for smart devices to aid in daily activities such as being able to control lights from bed.</li>
                <li>The following costs when moving into a new home (and replacing when they wear out):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lowering units refitting entire kitchen.</li>
                        <li>Refitting entire bathroom with wheeling shower and shower chair compatible toilet, etc.</li>
                        <li>Redo all carpets and floor with wheelchair suitable flooring and more regular replacement due to increased wheelchair wear and tear.</li>
                        <li>Redo front driveway so a wheelchair suitable solution (shingle, dirt or narrow paths are not suitable).</li>
                        <li>Low threshold doors all round.</li>
                        <li>Lowered windows or adaptations to reach windows and curtains.</li>
                        <li>Hoist to transfer out of chair into bed.</li>
                        <li>Widened doorways.</li>
                        <li>Ramps into house.</li>
                        <li>Additional light switch pull cords or remote controllable ones.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How the Voucher Scheme Fails to Address the Source of the Recent Spike in Claimants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Economic Impact: The rise in claimants is largely driven by economic factors that vouchers cannot address.</li>
                <li>Complex Needs: The increase in claimants includes individuals with complex needs that require flexible financial support not rigid vouchers.</li>
                <li>Long-Term Financial Planning: Disabled individuals need to save and invest to reduce long-term costs which vouchers do not support.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Highlighting Research from Scope</h2>
            <p>Research from Scope highlights the many additional costs that disabled individuals face which a voucher scheme would not adequately cover. You can read more about these extra costs on the <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns/extra-costs" target="_blank">Scope website</a>.</p>
