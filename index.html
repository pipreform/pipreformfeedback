            <h2>Why the Voucher Scheme is Impractical</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Variety of Needs: Disabled individuals have diverse needs that vary greatly from person to person. Vouchers may not cover the wide range of required expenses, many of our extra expenses are ongoing or wont fit into any predefined list of "approved" vouchers.</li>
                <li>Continual re-evaluation/reapplying: Much of our needs can be ad-hoc and change each month. Its not practical to assess every decision we make, figure out if its covered, find out how to clasify it and apply for the voucher and hope its on the approved list</li>
                <li>Administrative Burden: Managing and processing claims for every specific need through vouchers could create a significant administrative burden, leading to delays and inefficiencies. Either the disabled wont be able to claim for everything they need because the burden and overhead is too much or DWP will get overwelmed with all the requests</li>
                <li>Limited Approved Suppliers and items: A voucher system might limit users to specific suppliers, which could result in higher prices and reduced access to the most suitable or cost-effective products and services. This creates a lack of competition of choice as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Extra expenses many of  which won't or are impractical to put on a voucher scheme</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy Costs: We need to store extra equiptment meaning we need  a larger home which costs more to heat and some equipment itself requires energy as well.</li>
                <li>Support Costs: We are more limited in our ability to keep fit and we cant just get a cheap gym membership as we need Personal trainers etc. We may also need more therapists to manage our mental health.</li>
                <li>Maintenance Costs: Home repairs and maintenance due to wheelchair wear and tear.</li>
                <li>Travel Costs: Specialized transport and holiday accommodations. </li>
                <li>Companion Fees: Paying for a companion when unable to go alone. This could be holidays or other places we need to go when leaving our homes</li>
                <li>Delivery Fees: We cant just go shopping we need to get everything delivered and this costs money.</li>
                <li>Adaptive Equipment: Costs for necessary adaptive equipment. Not all of which will be covered by vouchers but will benefit us and aid in getting abit closer to a non disabled life.</li>
                <li>Cleaning Services: Paying for professional cleaners.</li>
                <li>Prescription Costs: Prescription are not free unless you have specific disabliities.</li>
                <li>Specialized Clothing: Higher costs for adaptive clothing.</li>
                <li>Vehicle Adaptations: Costs for adapting vehicles.</li>
                <li>Larger Vehicle costs: We cant fit a wheelchair in a small economical car we have to pay more, for a larger car which costs more to run. Not to mention if we were not disabled we could often avoid a car entirely</li>
                <li>Increased Insurance: Higher insurance premiums for larger, more expensive vehicles and homes.</li>
                <li>Higher Housing Costs: Higher rent or mortgage for larger, accessible housing.</li>
                <li>Housing Adaptions: We may need to adapt our homes to be able to wash or use basic utilities, and these adaptions need maintaining.</li>
                <li>Incontinence Costs: Costs for replacing clothes and additional laundry expenses.</li>
                <li>Smart Home Equipment: Costs for smart devices to aid in daily activities.</li>
                <li>Assistance with cleaning and other common tasks: We may need Assistance with cleaning our house or other mundain tasks. we cant fit our TV, everything can incur a extra cost</li>
                <li>Lost Time and Income: Additional time lost due to disability limiting the ability to work full time and increased sick leave.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How the Voucher Scheme Fails to Address the Source of the Recent Spike in Claimants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Economic Impact: The rise in claimants is largely driven by economic factors that vouchers cannot address.</li>
                <li>Complex Needs: The increase in claimants includes individuals with complex needs that require flexible financial support, not rigid vouchers.</li>
                <li>Long-Term Financial Planning: Disabled individuals need to save and invest to reduce long-term costs, which vouchers do not support.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Highlighting Research from Scope</h2>
            <p>Research from Scope highlights the many additional costs that disabled individuals face, which a voucher scheme would not adequately cover. You can read more about these extra costs on the <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns/extra-costs" target="_blank">Scope website</a>.</p>
