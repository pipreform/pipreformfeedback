            <h2>Why the Voucher Scheme is Impractical</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Variety of Needs: Disabled individuals have diverse needs that vary greatly from person to person. Vouchers may not cover the wide range of required expenses, from medical equipment to everyday necessities.</li>
                <li>Administrative Burden: Managing and processing claims for every specific need through vouchers could create a significant administrative burden, leading to delays and inefficiencies.</li>
                <li>Limited Approved Suppliers: A voucher system might limit users to specific suppliers, which could result in higher prices and reduced access to the most suitable or cost-effective products and services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How the Voucher Scheme Fails to Address the Source of the Recent Spike in Claimants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Economic Impact: The rise in claimants is largely driven by economic factors that vouchers cannot address.</li>
                <li>Complex Needs: The increase in claimants includes individuals with complex needs that require flexible financial support, not rigid vouchers.</li>
                <li>Long-Term Financial Planning: Disabled individuals need to save and invest to reduce long-term costs, which vouchers do not support.</li>
            </ul>
